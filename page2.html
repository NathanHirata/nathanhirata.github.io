                <p class="pad">This is 2 player pong. This game features changing colors of the ball and walls. I made pong because I wanted to make a simple multiplayer game. Things are always more fun with friends!
                    <br>
                    <br>How to play:
                    <br>Move up and down to reflect the ball with your wall to the opponents side. If the ball gets past your wall you lose and the opponents score increases, vice versa.
