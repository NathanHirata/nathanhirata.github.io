                    <p class="text2">This project is from my 11th grade physics class. It is inspired by Rube Goldberg. 
                        Rube Goldberg made change reaction contraptions that did simple things. My project makes a T.V. turn on. I love the idea of creating a machine from scratch to do whatever we want. The hardest part was calculating the weight, measurements, energy, etc. We had to add the "physics" part by writing what will happen and how much energy is being released after each step.
