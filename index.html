                    <p class="text">My name is Nathan Hirata. I am a senior at Pasadena High School. My favorite academic subjects are Math and History. I find math fun because there is only one correct solution and it also challenges my critical thinking skills. History is interesting to me because learning about the daily life of individuals back then compared to now makes me realize how far our human species has come, the inventions, events, and all the "what ifs" in history. Sports I like to play are football and basketball. I mostly play basketball but I'll play football whenever a game is available. I used to play in little basketball leagues when I was around 12-13 years old. I also watch and follow professional basketball and football. My favorite movie is "Pulp Fiction". Quentin Tarantino movies are master pieces.</p>
